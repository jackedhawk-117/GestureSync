# GestureSync üéØ


## Basic Details
###  Name: Janish Saji




### Project Description
GestureSync is a Python application that uses a standard webcam to translate real-world hand and face gestures into in-game keyboard and mouse actions. It has unique gestures for each game
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Improved immersion factor for less immersive games

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
GestureSync liberates your hands! By using advanced computer vision to track hand and face landmarks, it allows you to cast spells, issue tactical commands, and call your horse with nothing but a flick of the wrist .
