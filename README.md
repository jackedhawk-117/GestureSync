# GestureSync üéØ


## Basic Details
###  Name: Janish Saji




### Project Description
GestureSync is a Python application that uses a standard webcam to translate real-world hand and face gestures into in-game keyboard and mouse actions. It has unique gestures for each game
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Improved immersion factor for less immersive games

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
GestureSync improves immersion using your hands! By using advanced computer vision to track hand and face landmarks, it allows you to cast spells, issue tactical commands, and call your horse with nothing but a flick of the wrist .

The Witcher 3 Profile
This profile uses specific, named hand shapes to perform actions:

Call Roach: Touch your index finger to your mouth, as if you are whistling.

Quen Sign: Touch the tips of your thumb and index finger together to make a circle, with your other three fingers extended.

Aard Sign: Extend your index and middle fingers straight, with all other fingers curled in.

Igni Sign: Make a fist and extend your thumb outwards (a "thumbs-up").

Axii Sign: Extend your thumb and index finger to make an 'L' shape, with other fingers curled in.

Ready or Not Profile
This profile uses a two-step system for issuing commands:

Open Command Menu: First, make a closed fist (zero fingers extended). This opens the command menu in the game.

Select Command: After the menu is open, hold up the required number of fingers to issue a specific command:

Command 1: Hold up one finger.

Command 2: Hold up two fingers.

Command 3: Hold up three fingers.

Command 4: Hold up four fingers.

Command 5: Hold up five fingers (an open palm).*
